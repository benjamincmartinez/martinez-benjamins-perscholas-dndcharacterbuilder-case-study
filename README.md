# benjamins-perscholas-case-study
A repository chronicling the development of a dungeons and dragons digital companion. From building a simple character sheet using presets to developing your own homebrew material.

So far partway through phase one:

  -I have created the basic/preliminary front end design of the basic character builder, however it only covers core stats and skills and has no exportability.
  
  -Database configuration in progress for presentation purposes...
