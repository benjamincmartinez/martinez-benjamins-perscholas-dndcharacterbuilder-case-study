# Benjamins-RolePlayingCharacterTool
A repository chronicling the development of a dungeons and dragons digital companion. From building a simple character sheet using presets to developing your own homebrew material.

So far partway through phase two:

  //(phase 1)I have created the basic/preliminary front end design of the basic character builder, however it only covers core stats and skills and has no exportability.

  Phase 2: The stats and skills are all working, the characters data can be saved and viewed in json. Now I just need to prepare it to accept the larger dataset.
  
  -Database is in the middle of expanding, since presentation was a priority for this project...

<-- This is a presentation link.

This link "localhost:8080/dnd/build" while running the application will bring you to the character builder. Most buttons function is self explanatory, but it isn't too obvious 
yet that if you click on the Circles (big 'o') next to skills you can change your proficiency and the number in the field will match the stat. Actions, etc are in the midst of 
development as well.
